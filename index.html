           <br><p>My journey in learning the basics of web development was a challenging but rewarding experience. Initially, I found it difficult to understand the coding and design concepts. However, as I delved deeper, I was able to appreciate the complexity and beauty of web development. Throughout the course, I learned the importance of debugging and problem-solving, which were essential skills in my web development journey. Although there were ups and downs, I enjoyed the learning process and am proud of the skills I have acquired.I have learned how to use correct tags,attributes where they belong to.</p></br>
    
           <br><p>Looking back at my module experience, I can say that I have gained valuable knowledge and skills in web development. The module exposed me to various coding and design concepts that have prepared me for real-world projects. I appreciate the effort put in by the instructors and the challenges they provided, which allowed me to grow and learn new things.And thanks to our module teacher for always being back there in our hard time and giving response whenever we need it.</p></br>
    
          <br> <p>During the term, I developed a website from scratch, which was an excellent opportunity to apply the skills I had learned. I started with researching and moved on to coding the website. I chose a minimalistic design and used a simple color scheme to ensure the site was visually appealing. The font selection was crucial in ensuring the site was easy to read, and I chose sans-serif fonts. I also used various websites as a source of inspiration, which influenced the final design of the website.Mainly,I watched some youtube videos to make my website more attractive and pleasing. </p></br>
    
         <br><p> In conclusion, the web development module was an invaluable experience that has equipped me with the necessary skills for a career in web development. I am grateful for the opportunity and look forward to applying the skills I have learned.</p></br>
